<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## 📋 Getting Started

### 🗺️ Prerequisites

In this quiz project, there is a test folder containing the tests. A jest folder with files that are the same as in src except for the imports and exports at the beginning and end of the files, which allows their use for tests. Babel, which contains the transpiled code from src. src, which contains the code with comments before being transpiled by babel.


Before opening index.html, you need to install the modules with the command.

```bash
npm install
```

Transpile the code with babel

```bash
npm run babel
```

Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```


You don't need anything to run the project, just a browser.
